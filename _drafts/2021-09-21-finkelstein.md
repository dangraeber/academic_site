title: Place effects (on health and life expectancy)
---

Place effects are all over the place. But he underlying effects are poorly understood.




In recent years, many economic studies found that individuals' fait is shaped by so called "place effect". Chetty et al. identified that the neighborhood individuals are born into are important in shaping intergenerational mobility and that health varies considerably across regeions. Further, individuals moving to prosperous regions typically do better. Many of these studies are of a correlational nature and thus, are not able to isolate consistent causal place effects. That's where Finkelstein at al. contribute to. In an amazing study, they idetifiy place effects shaping individuals' health.

Their study is set in the U.S. and their regional unit of inquiry are commuting zones. The authors' outcome of interest is individuals' life expectancy. The *data* they use is administrative information on Medicare enrollees from 1999 to 2014.
