**"Intergenerational Health Mobility in Germany"** (sole authored; resubmitted to the Journal of Human Resources) [Draft available upon request]

{: style="text-align: justify" }

*Abstract:*  	We use 25 years of rich health information to describe three features of intergenerational health mobility in Germany. First, we describe the joint permanent health distribution of the parents and their children. A ten percentile increase in parental permanent health is associated with a 2.3 percentile increase in their child's health. Second, a percentile point increase in permanent health ranks is associated with a 0.8% to 1.4% increase in permanent income. Non-linearities in the association between health and income create incentives to escape the bottom of the permanent health distribution. Third, upward mobility in health varies with parental socio-economic status.

**"The effect of maternal education on offspring’s mental health."** No. 1028. SOEPpapers on Multidisciplinary Panel Data Research, 2021. (with Daniel D. Schnitzlein; under review) [Link to outdated working paper](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.617185.de/diw_sp1028.pdf)

*Abstract:* We estimate the effect of maternal schooling on children's mental health in adulthood. Using the Socio-Economic Panel and the mental health measure based on the SF-12 questionnaire, we exploit a compulsory schooling law reform to identify the causal effect of maternal schooling on children's mental health. While the theoretical considerations are ambiguous, we do not find that the mother's schooling has an effect on the mental health of the children. However, we find a positive effect on children's physical health operating mainly through physical functioning. In addition, albeit with the absence of an effect on mental health, we find evidence that the number of friends moderates the relationship between maternal schooling and their children's mental health.

**"Asylum Seekers and Host Country Mental Health: \\Evidence from Germany and Switzerland"** (with Prashant Bharadwaj and Stephanie Khoury) [Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k0h4xn4fu2npzu8/20200521_asylum_MH%20%281%29.pdf?dl=0)

Due to recent conflicts and humanitarian issues, millions of people have sought asylum in countries in Europe. The influx of asylum seekers has sparked debates about the impacts of such migratory flows on resident populations. We study how the recent migration of these forcibly displaced people into Europe affects the mental health of the receiving country residents in Switzerland and Germany. We exploit quasi-random variation in asylum seeker placement by matching settlement data with administrative health insurance data on mental health related treatments and survey data capturing self-reported mental health. Despite numerous possible mechanisms, in both countries, we find no economically meaningful effects of asylum seeker flows on residents' mental health.

**"Pandemic depression: COVID-19 and the mental health of entrepreneurs"** (with Marco Caliendo, Alexander Kritikos and Johannes Seebauer; revise and resubmit at Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice)

{: style="text-align: justify" }

*Abstract:* The disproportionate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on entrepreneurs when compared to employees is a global phenomenon. While the differential economic hardship is well documented, less is known about the effects of COVID-19 on their mental health. Using representative, longitudinal survey data from Germany, we show that financial losses appear to be an important driver of negative changes in mental health. Moreover, in particular female entrepreneurs experience a substantial deterioration in their mental health, while most male entrepreneurs are getting through the pandemic without significant changes. Investigating mechanisms behind this gendered impact of the pandemic, we find that female entrepreneurs who are directly affected by government-imposed restrictions on doing business, experience considerably larger increases in the frequency of anxiety and depressive symptoms, as do those who face additional child-care burden resulting from the closure of schools. Lastly, we observe that high levels of resilience help both gender to better cope with the crisis. Policy measures should account for this variation in mental health effects by supporting the affected entrepreneurs with more predictable policy instruments.

**"Hate is too great a burden to bear: Hate crimes and the mental health of refugees."** No. 1130. SOEPpapers on Multidisciplinary Panel Data Research, 2021. (with Felicitas Schikora) [Link to working paper](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.817746.de/publikationen/soeppapers/2021_1130/hate_is_too_great_a_burden_to_bear__hate_crimes_and_the_mental_health_of_refugees.html)

{: style="text-align: justify" }

*Abstract:* Against a background of increasing violence against non-natives, we estimate the effect of hate crime on refugees’ mental health in Germany. For this purpose, we combine two datasets: administrative records on xenophobic crime against refugee shelters by the Federal Criminal Office and the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees. We apply a regression discontinuity in time design to estimate the effect of interest. Our results indicate that hate crime has a substantial negative effect on several mental health indicators, including the Mental Component Summary score and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 score. The effects are stronger for refugees with closer geographic proximity to the focal hate crime and refugees with low country-speciﬁc human capital. While the estimated effect is only transitory, we argue that negative mental health shocks during the critical period after arrival have important long-term consequences.

**"Inequality of opportunity of wealth in Germany"** (with Viola Hilbert and Johannes König).

{: style="text-align: justify" }

*Abstract:* In this project, we describe the inequality of opportunity of wealth in Germany over time. New innovative survey data that surveys high wealth holders for the first time allows us to gauge the bias in inequality of opportunity of wealth and earnings which arises due to the underrepresentation of high wealth holders in conventional survey data. Our first estimates show that previous inequality of opportunity measures severly underestimate the inequality of opportunity in Germany.
