**"Hate is too great a burden to bear: Hate crimes and the mental health of refugees."** No. 1130. SOEPpapers on Multidisciplinary Panel Data Research, 2021. (with Felicitas Schikora) [Link to working paper](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.817746.de/publikationen/soeppapers/2021_1130/hate_is_too_great_a_burden_to_bear__hate_crimes_and_the_mental_health_of_refugees.html)

*Abstract:* Against a background of increasing violence against non-natives, we estimate the effect of hate crime on refugees’ mental health in Germany. For this purpose, we combine two datasets: administrative records on xenophobic crime against refugee shelters by the Federal Criminal Office and the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees. We apply a regression discontinuity in time design to estimate the effect of interest. Our results indicate that hate crime has a substantial negative effect on several mental health indicators, including the Mental Component Summary score and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 score. The effects are stronger for refugees with closer geographic proximity to the focal hate crime and refugees with low country-speciﬁc human capital. While the estimated effect is only transitory, we argue that negative mental health shocks during the critical period after arrival have important long-term consequences.

**"The effect of maternal education on offspring’s mental health."** No. 1028. SOEPpapers on Multidisciplinary Panel Data Research, 2021. (with Daniel D. Schnitzlein) [Link to outdated working paper](https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.617185.de/diw_sp1028.pdf)

*Abstract:* We estimate the effect of maternal schooling on children's mental health in adulthood. Using the Socio-Economic Panel and the mental health measure based on the SF-12 questionnaire, we exploit a compulsory schooling law reform to identify the causal effect of maternal schooling on children's mental health. While the theoretical considerations are ambiguous, we do not find that the mother's schooling has an effect on the mental health of the children. However, we find a positive effect on children's physical health operating mainly through physical functioning. In addition, albeit with the absence of an effect on mental health, we find evidence that the number of friends moderates the relationship between maternal schooling and their children's mental health.

**"Inequality of opportunity of wealth in Germany"** (with Viola Hilbert and Johannes König).

*Abstract:* In this project, we describe the inequality of opportunity of wealth in Germany over time. New innovative survey data that surveys high wealth holders for the first time allows us to gauge the bias in inequality of opportunity of wealth and earnings which arises due to the underrepresentation of high wealth holders in conventional survey data. Our first estimates show that previous inequality of opportunity measures severly underestimate the inequality of opportunity in Germany.
