"Inequality of Opportunity of Wealth in Germany" (with Viola Hilbert and Johannes KÃ¶nig).

In this project, we describe the inequality of opportunity of wealth in Germany over time. New innovative survey data that surveys high wealth holders for the first time allows us to gauge the bias in inequality of opportunity of wealth and earnings which arises due to the underrepresentation of high wealth holders in conventional survey data. Our first estimates show that previous inequality of opportunity measures severly underestimate the inequality of opportunity in Germany.
