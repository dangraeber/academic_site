Here, I share some summaries, notes and findings. I am currently not teaching. And teaching and writing helps me to reflect and digest new informatin. Therefore, I share some insights at this place. Maybe this is helpful for others too.

  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <h4><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h4>
      {{ post.excerpt }}

    </li>
  {% endfor %}
