<h1>Research blog</h1>


Here, I share some summaries, notes and findings. This is mainly for me to reflect about things. But maybe this is interesting for others too.

  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <h2><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
