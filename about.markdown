 <font size="5"> I am a postdoctoral researcher in the SOEP department at the DIW Berlin. I am a health economist interested in understanding how socio-economic differences in health are transmitted across generations. My research also covers the interaction between immigration and mental health as well as the economics of the COVID-19 pandemic. You can contact me via dgraeber [at] diw [dot] de.</font>
