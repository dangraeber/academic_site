 I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.615551.en/research_infrastructure__socio-economic_panel__soep.html">SOEP</a> department at the <a href="https://www.diw.de/en">DIW Berlin</a>, as well as a Research Affiliate at the <a href="https://www.iza.org/de">IZA Bonn</a> and a Senior Member at the <a href="https://uni-potsdam.de/en/cepa/welcome-to-cepa">Center for Economic Policy Analysis (CEPA)</a>. At the SOEP, I am responsible for research on well-being. My current research is centered on health economics, intergenerational mobility, and the formation of risk preferences. I am also interested in the economics of entrepreneurship. My research has been published in journals such as *Entrepreneurship, Theory and Practice (IF = 10.5)*, *Journal of Population Economics (IF = 6.5)*, and *PLOS ONE (IF = 3.7)*. In 2022, I received an award for one of the best publications at DIW Berlin. You can contact me via dgraeber [at] diw [dot] de.

 Since 2023, I am the proud father of a fabulous daughter. I will be on paternal leave from November 9, 2023, until May 8, 2024.
