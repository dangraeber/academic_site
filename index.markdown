 **Welcome to my webpage!**

 {: style="text-align: justify" }

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href ="https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.615551.en/research_infrastructure__socio-economic_panel__soep.html">SOEP</a> department at the <a href="https://www.diw.de/en">DIW Berlin</a>, as well as a Research Affiliate at the <a href="https://www.iza.org/de">IZA Bonn</a> and a Senior Member at the <a href="https://uni-potsdam.de/en/cepa/welcome-to-cepa">Center for Economic Policy Analysis (CEPA)</a> . I received my PhD summa cum laude from the University of Potsdam in 2021 and am a dedicated health economist and labor economist. My research focuses on understanding the transmission of socio-economic differences in health across generations, as well as the interaction between immigration and mental health. I also study the economics of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically the impact of lockdowns, the lockdowns' effects on the well-being of employees and self-employed persons, and vaccination efforts. In 2022, I received an award for one of the best publications at the DIW Berlin. Since 2023, I am the proud father of a fabulous daughter. You can contact me via dgraeber [at] diw [dot] de.
