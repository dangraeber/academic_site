# Summary and Discussion of "Reallocation Effects of the Minimum Wage" by Dustmann, Lindner, Schoenberg, Umkehrer and vom Berge

The minimum wage is one of the most highly debated topics among economists. The reason is that in neoclassical models of the labor market, individuals with lower marginal productivity will be priced out of the market once a minimum wage above the equilibrium wage rate is established. However, empirical evidence on the employment effects of minimum wage introductions are fairly mixed. As a consequence, the introduction of the minimum wage was accompanied by a vigorous discussion of the pros and cons of a minimum wage rate. In 2015, the federal government introduced a universal minimum wage of 8.50â‚¬. This corresponds to about 57% of the median hourly wage in Germany in 2015.

Enter stage left, Dustman et al. (2021). Dustman et al. (2021) evaluated the introduction of the minimum wage in Germany in their 2021 QJE paper. The innovation they bring to the table are twofold: First, they rely on administrative data on hourly wages. This is an important innovation since until now, administrative data on hourly wage rates was not available in administrative data bases. Previous evaluations relied on survey data, such as the SOEP. Second, Dustman et al. (2021) investigate the reallocation effects of the minimum wage. Reallocation refers to the reallocation of workers between firms in this case.

To be precise, they rely on individual level administrative records taken from Federal Employment Agency's Statistics Department that covers all workers in the social security system plus marginal workers. They enrich this **data** with novel data on workers' employment histories of the Institute for Employment Research in Nuremberg. This data includes information on earnings and working hours at least once a year from each job. Note that the information on working hours is only available until 2014. They have to impute the information for working hours for the years after 2014 with the information from 2014.

In their **empirical mehtod**, Dustman et al. (2021) rely on two different approaches: (i) an individual level analysis and (ii) a regional analysis.  In the individual level analysis, the authors regress the wage growth between two periods on indicators for the individuals' wage bins, at the begin of the two periods and individual level controls, which stem also from the begin of the period. This approach has two drawbacks: First, as the authors discuss, individuals with lower wages generally experience higher wage growth between subsequent periods of time. This is often described as mean reversion. Second, trends in macroeconomic conditions might confound the results. But, to account for the differential wage growth in each wage bin, they trace out the pre period wage growth so that the resulting effect estimate corresponds to the individuals' two year wage growth, relative to the two-year growth in the 2011 to 2013 pre-policy period. Further, they pure out the potential confounding effect of macroeconomic trends driving heterogenous wage growth by "correcting" the estimates by means of the wage growth of high wage earners, that are unaffected by the minimum wage. This leads directly to the **identifiying assumptions** they have to envoke: Mean reversion in the wage growth and macroeconomic time effects are stable over time. Dustman et al. (2021) find empirical support for this identifying assumption.


In their results, individuals' wage growth is as high as 5.4% for individuals directly affected and a treatment effect of 1.5% suggests spillover effects to the next highest wage bin (8.5-12.5 Euro). They further find that the effects are largest for daily wages. I believe this does not come as a surprise. The question is, did the minimum wage introduction cause individuals to loose their employment? To investigate the effect on the employment probabilities, Dustmann et al. apply their identification strategy to the employment probability (of individuals who are employed in the pre-policy period). What they find is that the change in the employment probability is similar in the pre- and post-policy period. If anything, the relative employment probability increased relatively. Thus, individuals at the lower end of the wage distribution experienced an increase in the wage growth due to the introduction of the minimum wage. At the same time, the employment probability did not change. Therefore, Dustman et al. conclude that the minimum wage introduction indeed reduced inequality.

Then, they turn to the role of reallocation effects. For that, they focus on baseline characteristics of the workers' firms. To put it differently, the applied their framework for the individual level analysis to the proxies for firm level quality, estimated in the pre-policy area. First they focus on effect of the minimum wage introduction on the establishments' average daily wages at the baseline. The establishments' average daily wage for low age earners increases by about 1.8% relative to the pre-policy period. Thus, the authors conclude that about 17% of the minimum wage effects are due to between establishments moves and the remainder is due to within establishment changes.

Those wage increases could be due to a multitude of effects:

* The share of high-skilled workers increases by about 2.9%
* The share of full-time workers by 3%
* The wage premium is 1.8%

They also check for additional proxies for the establishment quality and find improvements across the board. Additionally, they check for heterogenous effects across individual workers' characteristics and find little differences. However, they find the reallocation effects are more pronounced for workers working in the sector for non-tradable goods as well as food, cleaning, security, and logistics FSCL occupations

After those individual level results, Dustmann et al. investigate the role of reallocation effects in explaining the minimum
